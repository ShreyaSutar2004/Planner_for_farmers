# Farmer's Planner

## Overview
The Farmer's Planner is a smart application designed to provide personalized agricultural recommendations to farmers based on their specific conditions. Users can input information about their location, crop type, soil type, and the current month, and the planner generates tailored advice alongside the current temperature and humidity that are optimal for their farming needs.

## Features
- **Location-Based Recommendations:** Provides insights specific to the farmer's geographical area.
- **Crop Type Selection:** Users can select from various crops to receive crop-specific advice.
- **Soil Type Analysis:** Recommendations are tailored based on the type of soil.
- **Month-Sensitive Guidance:** Offers advice that is relevant to the current month of the year.
- **Environmental Insights:** Displays current temperature and humidity levels ideal for chosen crops.

## How It Works
1. **Input Requirements:**
   - Farmer's location (Geographical coordinates or region)
   - Crop type (e.g., wheat, corn, vegetables)
   - Soil type (e.g., clay, sandy, loamy)
   - Current month (e.g., March)

2. **Output:**
   - Recommended actions for planting, irrigation, fertilization, etc.
   - Current temperature and humidity data tailored to crop needs.
